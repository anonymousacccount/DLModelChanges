# RQ3: Benchmarking existing decompositon styles
In this folder, we provide the source code and results of our experimental evaluation. 

1. FinalResult.xlsx: This file includes the results for all the experiments in separate sheets.
2. The Structure.xlsx: This file shows the design structure matrix that we presented in Table 10. 

Due to the large size of the source code, we upload it on HuggingFace and can be downloaded here:
