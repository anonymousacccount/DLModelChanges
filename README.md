# ICSE2025 - #175

We provide the data and source code for the three research questions (RQ) discussed in the paper: An Empirical Study on Requirement Changes in
Deep Learning Models

The repository is organized into three folders, one for each RQ.

RQ 1. Taxonomy of DL model changes: The results for this RQ are in folder Data Collection. In this folder, we present the source code for mining Github repositories with the relevant criteria. The file README.md inside this folder contains information about all the files in it.

RQ 2. User Study: We provide the questions used to conduct the study. We also provide examples of responses received and our analysis of the responses. Please note that due to IRB limitations we are unable to provide the exact responses as received from the participants.

RQ 3. Benchmarking Existing Decomposition Styles: Due to limited space in the paper, we only presented results for 3 classes for output-based decomposition. We present all the results in folder Benchmarking. It contains the results for all experiments and the design structure matrix for the changes. Since the size of the source code is not supported by GitHub, we share the source code and our models and datasets in an external link available in README.md inside the folder.
